I created this artifical intelligence, using python language , for our E-sport society as we launch our first gaming event and to choose team randomly, i think why not create an AI as i am btech CS student.
To use this AI , simply run main file code, in any python compiler , and The Professor named (AI), will response your queries.
As i created it for random team selection , but at the end i thought why not to add some features.
So i simply entered some simple algo's using if loop, if that particular word is in loop than my professor will return to you positively.
